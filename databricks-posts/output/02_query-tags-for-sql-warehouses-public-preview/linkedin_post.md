OUTPUT 1: LinkedIn Post
------------------------

Meeting a customer today who's spent hours tracking down the source of a long-running query in their SQL warehouse. They asked me if there was an easier way. There is now.

Databricks has just announced Query Tags for SQL warehouses (Public Preview). With this feature, you can apply custom key-value tags to workloads for grouping, filtering, and cost attribution.

No more sifting through system logs or query histories to find the culprit behind those slow queries. Instead, just tag them as they appear in your Databricks UI.
