Just noticed this: Databricks' Default SQL warehouse settings are now GA 🔜

What if you could define a warehouse as the default for all SQL authoring surfaces in your workspace? Well, now you can 🎯

Why does it matter? It means less manual configuration and easier collaboration for data teams 🤝

How to get started? Set your workspace's default SQL warehouse and allow individual users to override if needed. Learn more 👉 [Set a default SQL warehouse](https://docs.databricks.com/sql-analysis/sql-warehouse/set-default-workspace-sql-warehouse.html)
