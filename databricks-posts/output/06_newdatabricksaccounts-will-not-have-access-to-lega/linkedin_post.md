New year, new Databricks accounts! ð Starting Dec 18, say goodbye to DBFS root & mounts, Hive Metastore, and No-isolation compute. Instead, enjoy the benefits of Unity Catalog for streamlined governance and enhanced security. Let's embrace this change together! #databricks #unitycatalog #governance #security
