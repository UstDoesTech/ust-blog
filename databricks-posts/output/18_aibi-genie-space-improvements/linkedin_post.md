A new day for data: Genie space improvements at Databricks

A quiet revolution in data workflows today — embedded compute credentials and improved usability with paginated column lists and tag search in Genie spaces at Databricks. But why should we care?

Embedded compute means no more fiddling with credentials, making your data pipelines faster and more efficient. Pagination simplifies navigation of complex tables, while tag search makes finding the right Genie space a breeze. These changes may seem small, but they add up to a more pleasant data journey.

But what about the "how"? Here's where to start:
1. Update your warehouse in a Genie space. Embedded compute credentials will automatically be created for that space.
2. Access paginated column lists in the Configure tab of your tables, enjoying smoother navigation and quicker access to insights.
3. Tag your spaces for easy discovery by your team or others on the Databricks platform.
