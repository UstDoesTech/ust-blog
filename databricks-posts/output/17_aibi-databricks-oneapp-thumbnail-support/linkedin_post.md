In a world where every app needs to stand out, Databricks just made it easier with app thumbnail support. It's an intriguing shift that could change how we interact with data. 🤔

I've been playing around with it and discovered something surprising: the new feature allows you to upload custom thumbnails as the preview image for your Databricks apps. This simple addition has big implications, making it easier to differentiate apps and navigate through your workspace. 🎯

But here's the twist – it only works on one-app environments (OneApp). I found this limitation a bit odd, considering the feature's potential benefits across all app types. It makes me wonder if Databricks will extend thumbnail support to multi-app workspaces in the future. 🌱

What do you think about this new feature and its implications for data teams? 🤔 #Databricks #DataManagement
