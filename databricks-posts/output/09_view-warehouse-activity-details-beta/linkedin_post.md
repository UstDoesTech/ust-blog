A new way to peek under the hood 🤔

Databricks just announced "View warehouse activity details" (Beta), adding color-coded bars to the Running clusters chart in the SQL warehouse monitoring UI. It's like X-ray vision for your data workflows 🔍

Here's where it gets interesting: hover over bars to see metadata, or click on fetching activity to filter the query history table. This level of transparency can help you optimise resources and resolve issues more efficiently.

But don't take my word for it. Check it out yourself: [Monitor a SQL warehouse](ustdoes.tech) #DataTransparency #Databricks
