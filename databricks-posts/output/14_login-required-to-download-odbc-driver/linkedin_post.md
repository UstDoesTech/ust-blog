Question: Tired of downloading Databricks ODBC drivers without a login? 😴 Here's some great news!

From now on, you'll need to log in to Databricks and accept our license terms before downloading the Simba Apache Spark ODBC Driver. This ensures everyone uses the latest version and follows proper licensing. 🎉

If you work on AWS GovCloud, just reach out to your account team for access to the driver. Easy peasy! 🧀
