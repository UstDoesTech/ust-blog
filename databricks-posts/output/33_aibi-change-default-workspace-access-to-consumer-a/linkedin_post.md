Hey DataFolks! 👋 Ever struggled with managing access for business users in Databricks? Here's a game changer 🚀

Introducing Change default workspace access to Consumer access (Public Preview)! Now, you can configure new users to receive Consumer access by default using group cloning. This means less hassle and more streamlined onboarding 🤝

This feature brings us Databricks One, a view-only experience for business users who need to view and interact with dashboards, Genie spaces, and apps without creating workspace objects. No more worrying about accidental changes or overwriting important data! 🔥

So, let's simplify access management today! 🔒 Comment below if you're as excited as I am about this new feature. #Databricks #AIML #DataAccess #DataManagement #StreamlineWorkflow
