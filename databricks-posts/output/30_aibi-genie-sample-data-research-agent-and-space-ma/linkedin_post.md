New Genie improvements: Sample data, Research Agent, and more! 🧞‍♂️📊

A few months ago, I stumbled upon a fascinating Genie space while exploring Databricks' latest features. It was a messy tangle of tables and functions—but there was something intriguing about it. Today, I'm excited to share some enhancements that have made this space more navigable and valuable for data teams like yours.

Firstly, say goodbye to the guessing game with sample data! Now you can view a snapshot of the context behind a Genie space by simply clicking on 'View Sample Data.' This will help you make sense of Manage data objects and Text answer summaries in API. 💡🤔

Secondly, if you've ever felt overwhelmed by research questions, the new Research Agent starter questions (Beta) are here to help! These curated questions offer an excellent starting point for your explorations. 🚀🧩

Thirdly, the landing page redesign has made it even easier to read and understand starter questions. And if you're still not satisfied with a benchmark execution, fret no more—it will now execute correctly with AI functions. ✅🎉

Last but not least, space managers can now manage feedback more effectively. You can update thumbs up/down feedback from other users and re-run query results from other users' messages using your own data credentials to debug feedback. 🤝🔍

One thing I found particularly exciting was the increase in the maximum character length for example SQL titles—it has been bumped up to a whopping 1024 characters! 🎉🚀

What if these enhancements could help your team work more efficiently and make data-driven decisions with greater confidence? I'd love to hear your thoughts.
