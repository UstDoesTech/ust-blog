In a workspace, a new user arrives. A dashboard is shared, a question asked, a collaboration begun. Today, Databricks makes this moment smoother with a change to default workspace access (Public Preview). Here's the workings:

Instead of Workspace Access, users will now receive Consumer Access by default when added to a group using group cloning. This provides view-only access to Databricks One - dashboards, Genie spaces, apps for business users who don't need to create workspace objects.

For data teams, this means easier onboarding of consumers at scale. Existing users' authoring privileges are preserved while new users get the streamlined, view-only experience they need. But what about those existing users? Well, we found that giving them a tour of the new setup, instead of just telling them, made all the difference.

So, how does it work? Group cloning is the tool for admins to configure new users with Consumer Access by default. For existing users, well, they'll be moved to a new group that only grants Consumer entitlement. Simple, yet effective.

Remember, every action in our data-driven world has ripples. This change is no exception. It's a step towards making collaboration easier and more inclusive for all, one user at a time. What do you think? ustdoes.tech #databricks #collaboration
