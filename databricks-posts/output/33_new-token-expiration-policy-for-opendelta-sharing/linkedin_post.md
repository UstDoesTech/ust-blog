🚨 Big news for Databricks users! 🚨
New token expiration policy for openDelta Sharing means more secure data sharing! 💪

As of today, all new tokens will expire in a year. Tokens with longer lifetimes or no expiration date can't be created anymore. Existing ones expire on Dec 8, 2026, if they exceed a one-year limit or have no expiration date.

If you're using tokens with extended or unlimited lifetimes, it's time to review your integrations and renew them ASAP to avoid disruptions after Dec 2026. 🔄🚀
