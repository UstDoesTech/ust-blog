OUTPUT 1: LinkedIn Post
-----------------------
A peek into the future of Databricks: Decrypt query history system table fields, now in public preview for workspaces using customer-managed keys (CMK). But here's the curious twist - we're only decrypting the statement_text and error_message fields. Why? To ensure data teams can troubleshoot queries more efficiently, without compromising security.

How does it work? It's simple: just enable data encryption settings in the system catalog of your CMK-enabled workspace. But what if it doesn't solve all your problems? Well, that's where the art of querying comes into play. And remember, this is a journey, not a destination. So let's stay curious and keep asking "what if?"
