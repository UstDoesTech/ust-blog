A curious find for data teams: Directly import Databricks tables into Google Sheets as pivot tables 📊🖇️

Curiosity led us to stumble upon this feature that streamlines the process of working with data in both platforms. It's like having your cake and eating it too! But how does it work, you ask? Here's a sneak peek:

1. From the Databricks catalog explorer, select the table you wish to import.
2. Choose 'Connect to Google Sheets'.
3. Select which parts of the data you want to display in a pivot table format.

This new feature enables data teams to leverage the power of Databricks' compute engine and Google Sheets' user-friendly interface for analysis, visualisation, and collaboration. But remember, every data journey starts with a single step—so why not take this one? 🌞
