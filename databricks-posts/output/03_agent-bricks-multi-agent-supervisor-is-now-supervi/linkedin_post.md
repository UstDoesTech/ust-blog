-----------------------
On the job today, I found myself pondering the recent rebrand of Agent Bricks' Multi-Agent Supervisor to Supervisor Agent. It got me thinking about the power of simple names - they can make complex concepts approachable, right? 🤔

The new Supervisor Agent allows for easy creation and coordination of multi-agent systems. No more juggling multiple supervisors! It's a small change, but it'll save us plenty of time in the long run. Curious to see how this will shape our data workflows in the future. What are your thoughts? 🤔💭
