A moment of clarity in Databricks Apps: Filter out inactives, find your favourites

I was browsing Databricks Apps today, when I noticed something peculiar. Hidden amidst the sea of active apps were a few inactives – those with statuses like Stopped, Deploying, or Crashed. As a curious expert, this got me thinking. What if we could filter them out?

Databricks has answered my "what if" with their latest improvements. You can now include or exclude inactive apps when browsing, making it easier to find what you need. But that's not all – search now supports dashboard widget titles, and certified and favourite content is boosted in search rankings.

And here's a surprising detail: Recents and favourites are now surfaced in the For You page. One unexpected moment of wit, added to make your data journey more personalized.

What if you could find exactly what you need, faster? The future of data discovery just got a little clearer.
