In the lab today: Tagging Databricks Apps 🚀

I've been experimenting with the new public preview feature, and I must say - it's a game changer! 🤔

As data teams manage an increasing number of apps, organisation becomes crucial. Now, you can apply tags toDatabricks apps to categorise and keep things tidy. It might not seem groundbreaking, but trust me, it makes all the difference when you're trying to find a specific app in a sea of possibilities! 🌊

But... there's a catch. Search functionality isn't supported usingDatabricks appstags just yet. So, while organisation is streamlined, discoverability still requires some legwork. 🤔

What do you think? Will tagging help declutter your Databricks workspace? Let's talk about it! 💬
