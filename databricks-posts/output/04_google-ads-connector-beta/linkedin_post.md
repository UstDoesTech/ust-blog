A first look at the beta Google Ads connector on Databricks
----------------------------------------------------------

Last week, I was tinkering with Lakeflow Connect - Databricks' new data integration tool - and stumbled upon something intriguing: a beta Google Ads connector. Here's what I found...

I was curious to see how well it would handle complex ad data, so I decided to test it out with one of our clients who has a sprawling digital advertising setup. The result? Surprisingly seamless ingestion and near-instantaneous analysis.

But here's the kicker: the connector seems to have been designed with data democratization in mind, allowing even non-experts to quickly query ad performance metrics and make informed decisions.

Now, you might be wondering: how does this work exactly? The process is simple:

1. Enable the Google Ads API on your Databricks workspace.
2. Set up the connector in Lakeflow Connect.
3. Choose the specific ad data you want to ingest (e.g., campaign, ad group, keyword performance).
4. Let Lakeflow Connect do its magic, and voilà - your Google Ads data is now available in Databricks for analysis!

So, why does this matter? For data teams like ours, it means a more streamlined way to incorporate ad data into our analytics workflows, which translates to better insights and ultimately, smarter decisions.

But what about those who aren't data experts? They can now leverage the power of Databricks for ad performance analysis without having to write complex SQL queries or navigate confusing interfaces. It's a win-win!

As always, if you have thoughts or questions, feel free to share them below. Let's keep learning together!
