A fresh take on data dashboards: custom calculations, subscriptions, and visualization enhancements 📈💡

It's no secret that our DataBricks collaborations are always pushing boundaries. This time around, we're excited to share some game-changing updates for data dashboards!

Custom calculations can now reference other custom calculations on dashboard datasets. Say goodbye to repetition and hello to more efficient, streamlined visualizations 📊

And here's a surprise: stacked bar charts now display cumulative totals, making it even easier for data teams to grasp complex trends over time 🔢

Of course, we haven't forgotten about you account-level users. Now, dashboard authors can subscribe you to scheduled updates—a feature that will save countless hours of manual checking 🕒

We've also given our tooltips and static widget filter drop-down menus a much-needed makeover for improved accessibility and functionality!

As always, remember curiosity drives progress. So take these new features for a spin, and let the data stories unfold ✨
