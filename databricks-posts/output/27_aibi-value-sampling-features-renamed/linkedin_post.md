Discovering something odd about the renamed AI/BI value sampling features on Databricks. 🤔

Turns out, it's a smart move to rename them for clarity — but what's intriguing is the reasoning behind each new name.

Prompt matching was previously known as value sampling. But why the change? The old name suggested that it only works with values (which can be misleading). Now, it better reflects that it matches prompts too. 💭

Format assistance used to be example values. This wasn't wrong per se, but it didn't capture the feature's true essence. With its new name, it signifies more than just providing examples — it helps with format assistance! 💡

Lastly, value dictionaries are now entity matching. The switch is aimed at making it clear that this feature doesn't only work with values, but entities too. A subtle distinction that shows the thoughtfulness behind these updates. 🤔

So, what does this change mean for data teams? More clarity and better understanding of these powerful tools! 🎉
