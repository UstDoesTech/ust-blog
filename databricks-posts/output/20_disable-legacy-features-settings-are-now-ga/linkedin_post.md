🔓 Exciting news for Databricks users! 🔓
Just announced: Disable legacy features settings are now GA! 🚀

This means you can migrate your accounts and workspaces to Unity Catalog with ease. With the 'Disable legacy features' account-level setting, access to DBFS, Hive Metastore, and No-isolation shared compute in new workspaces will be blocked. And for enhanced control, the workspace-level setting lets you disable access to the Hive metastore used by your workspace.

Upgrade now for a smoother, more streamlined experience! 🌟 #Databricks #UnityCatalog #LegacyFeatures #Migration #DataGovernance
