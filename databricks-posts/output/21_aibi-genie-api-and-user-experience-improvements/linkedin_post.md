# LinkedIn Post Draft: [AI/BI] Genie API and user experience improvements

Just tried out the latest Databricks Genie API updates. Here's a quick thought:

The new API endpoint for downloading complete result sets up to 1GB is a game-changer - no more fiddling with chunks and stitching together pieces! But what I find truly exciting is the fix for chart generation from prompts. It resolves an irritating issue that's been bothering me for some time now.

However, it's not all smooth sailing. The collapsible error messages are a welcome addition, but there's still room for improvement in the user interface - especially when it comes to permission warnings. I hope future updates will make it even more intuitive for data teams.

What about you? Have you noticed any significant improvements with these latest updates? #Databricks #DataAI
