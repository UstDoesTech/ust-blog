This blog will cover Azure Data Catalog. With the rise of self-service business intelligence tools, like Power BI, and an increased engagement with data in the workplace, people’s expectations of where they can find expert information about data has changed. Where previously there would an expert that people would have to book time with in order to understand data, now people expect to get quick and detailed information about the data assets that an enterprise holds and maintains without going through a single contact. With Azure Data Catalog, data consumers can quickly discover data assets and gain knowledge about the data from documentation, tags and glossary terms from the subject matter experts. This post aims to give a brief introduction to Azure Data Catalog and what it can broadly be used for.

## What is Azure Data Catalog?

It is a fully managed Azure service which is an enterprise-wide metadata catalogue that enables data discovery. With ADC, you register; discover; annotate; and, for some sources, connect to data assets. It is also designed to manage disparate information about data; to make it easy to find data assets, understand them, and connect to them. Any user (analyst, data scientist, or developer) can discover, understand, and consume data sources. Azure Data Catalog is a one-stop central shop for all users to contribute their knowledge and build a community and culture of data.

## What can Azure Data Catalog be used for?

As mentioned in the earlier headings, Itcan be used for data asset management; data governance; and data discovery. For data asset management, this means knowing what data is available and where; for data governance teams, this means answering questions like: where is my customer data? or what does this data model look like?; for data discovery, this means knowing which data is suitable for particular reports and who you can go to if you have any questions. There are some [common scenarios for using Azure Data Catalog](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-catalog/data-catalog-common-scenarios) that Microsoft has put together, and it’s well worth reading to get a fuller understanding of what ADC can be used for.
