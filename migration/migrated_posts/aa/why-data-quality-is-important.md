Data is among the most valuable assets for any organisation. Without data, the ability to make informed decisions is diminished. So it stands to reason that Data Quality is incredibly important to any organisation. If data doesn’t meet the expectations of accuracy, validity, completeness, and consistency that an organisation sets it, then the data could have severe implications for the organisation. Conversely, if data does meet those expectations, then it is a real asset that can be used to drive value across an organisation.

## Impact of Data Quality

The impact of poor quality data has been estimated to have cost the [U.S. economy $3 Trillion in 2016](https://hbr.org/2016/09/bad-data-costs-the-u-s-3-trillion-per-year?utm_content=179514481&utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkedin&hss_channel=lis-HB_hMVbwP0). We’re now 6 years on, the size of the U.S. economy is much larger; the volumes of data more vast; the complexity of that data has grown - so has the impact of bad data also grown in value? That is difficult to assess - because the original estimate was based on a load of assumptions like the time and number of employees engaged in correcting, or working around, poor data quality, as well as the assumed cost of poorly informed decisions - but for the sake of simplicity, we can assume that this cost to a single economy has also grown.

We can safely assume this because a lot of organisations do not have data quality at the top of the priority lists. Why might this be the case? Because monitoring data quality and correcting poor quality data is hard. If it was easy, every organisation would have a strategy and method for tracking and improving data quality.

Often, inertia - driven by an overwhelming amount of information to the risks - sets in as it’s difficult to know where to start. So, where do you start?

## Determine Data Quality

Handily, there are industry defined dimensions for assessing data, as defined by the [Data Management Association (DAMA)](https://www.dama.org/cpages/home).
