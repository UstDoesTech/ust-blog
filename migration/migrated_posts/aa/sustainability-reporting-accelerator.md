Social expectations of businesses and industries are increasing—in relation to Environment, Society and Governance (ESG) following the United Nations' adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and in relation to climate change following the Paris Agreement's adoption at the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP21). Many organisations are aligning their business to address the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in order to create a cleaner, healthier, and more sustainable society.

 We recently completed a project with a leading financial services provider in the UK, offering financial solutions to clients, brokers, and businesses of all sizes and specialisations. Retail point of sale finance, motor finance and personal loans, asset finance and invoice finance, and vehicle funding and fleet management are among the financial services provided by this client.

 In order to help make achieving their sustainability targets a reality, the client required a number of reports to be generated to support the sustainability initiatives. Currently, the reports are generated manually by client's Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) team. These reports are created by aggregating data from various sources across all business units.

 The client were looking for a solution to automate the report generation with the use of their existing data lakehouse infrastructure. During previous engagements, Advancing Analytics designed, built, and implemented the current data lakehouse platform utilising the Hydr8™ framework. This Sustainability phase used data that was already onboarded to the data lakehouse platform to create multiple reports necessary for sustainability reporting.

 Since 1 October 2013 the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors’ Report) Regulations 2013 have required all UK quoted companies to report on greenhouse gas emissions as part of their annual Directors' Report.

 From 1 April 2019, quoted companies must report on their global energy use and large businesses must publish their UK yearly energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. This is required by the Companies (Directors’ Report) and Limited Liability Partnerships (Energy and Carbon Report) Regulations 2018.

 The Companies (Directors’ Report) and Limited Liability Partnerships (Energy and Carbon Report) Regulations 2018 implement the government’s policy on Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting. These make amendments to the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 and the Limited Liability Partnerships (Accounts and Audit) (Application of Companies Act 2006) Regulations 2008 (‘the Regulations’).

 To comply with regulations, our client is required to produce on a number of sustainability reports listed below:

1. Net Zero Full Financial Year Report
2. Green Bond Impact Report
3. Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting (SECR)
4. Annual Report and Consolidated Financial Statements
5. ESG Environmental Annual Report
6. Sustainable Business Reporting
7. Energy Saving Opportunity Scheme (ESOS)
8. TCFD Climate Risk
9. Carbon Reduction Plan (PPN06/21)

 Prior to this engagement, the client was spending months manually collating this data across the estate and bringing it together in a series of Excel reports to satisfy regulatory reporting.

 The reporting largely revolves around scopes of emissions, as visualised in the following diagrams:
