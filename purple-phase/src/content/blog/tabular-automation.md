At SQL Bits, Europe's largest data conference, I presented a Tabular Automation with TMSL and PowerShell. By now, I was a seasoned speaker but was still quite nervous, especially as the attendees of my session included members from Microsoft's development team. Feedback from them, was that it was nice to demonstrate how TMSL could be used outside what it was originally intended to do.

Video to the session can be found on the [SQL Bits](https://sqlbitsvideo.streaming.mediaservices.windows.net/df3d0ded-fad6-4c2e-a0d1-544c3eb5ab0d/5895_1920x1080_AACAudio_5860.mp4) website.
