At SQL Bits, Europe's largest data conference, I presented a Deep Dive Into Data Lakes. It was my first solo speaking session and was the 08:00 session on the Saturday - right after the Friday night party.

Video to the session can be found on the [SQL Bits](https://sqlbits.com/Sessions/Event16/A_Deep_Dive_Into_Data_Lakes?) website.
