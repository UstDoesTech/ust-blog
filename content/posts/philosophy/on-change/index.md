Change is, ironically, the only constant in life. Yet, despite its inevitability, we often meet change with resistance, and the silent hope that it might pass us by unnoticed. Change is often framed as something that needs to be managed.

At its core, the resistance we feel is not to change itself, but to what change threatens: the shifting of known into unknown, the disruption of routine, the loss of identity we have constructed within the stable boundaries of our past. The human mind, shaped by millennia of survival, prefers the familiar because it is predictable. It is safe.

## Why We Struggle

Each change, whether personal, technological, organisational, or societal, disturbs the delicate web of meanings we've spun to keep life orderly. We fear what we do not understand. We mourn what we must relinquish. We resist what we did not choose. And we tire when the pace of disruption outstrips our capacity to integrate it.

This is not weakness. It is humanity.

If we think about all the changes that are happening in the world today, it is easy to feel overwhelmed. The pace of change can be dizzying, and it is natural to want to retreat into the familiar, to cling to what we know. But this is not a sustainable response. Change is not going away; it is part of nature.

## Attitudes Toward Change

Change is not inherently good or bad; it is a force of nature, indifferent to our preferences. Our attitudes toward change shape our experiences of it. We can view change as a threat, a burden, or an opportunity.

You've likely seen the distribution of attitudes toward change represented in a bell curve: a small percentage of people are early adopters, a larger group is cautious but willing, the majority are resistant until change becomes unavoidable, and a small percentage are saboteurs actively opposing or undermining change. This distribution reflects our collective attitude toward change.

This bell curve has become a familiar trope in change management, but it is worth remembering that it is not a fixed law. People can and do shift their attitudes toward change over time, often influenced by their experiences, the context of the change, and the support they receive. Change needs to be managed, in the sense that we need to communicate, educate, and support those affected by it. But it is not a problem to be solved; it is a process to be navigated.

The one thing that any change management process cannot do is to eliminate the discomfort of change, or our emotional responses to it. Change is inherently unsettling, and it is natural to feel anxious, frustrated, or even angry when faced with it. These emotions are not obstacles to be overcome; they are signals that we are human, that we care about what we are losing or gaining. That is for us, as individuals, to own and to process.

## Toward Understanding, Not Escape

There are four classes of change that we encounter: those we initiate, those we endure, those we resist, and those we embrace. Each class carries its own lessons, its own burdens, and its own opportunities.

Initiated change is often the most exhilarating, as it is born from our own desires and aspirations. Endured change tests our resilience, challenging us to adapt without losing ourselves. Resisted change reveals our fears, exposing the fragility of our attachments. Embraced change, however, is where we find growth, renewal, and sometimes even joy.

But how do we move from resistance to embrace? How do we transform the fear of change into a willingness to engage with it?

Acknowledge that change is not merely as an event, but as a force. Change is not something that happens to us; it is something we live through. To resist it entirely is to freeze ourselves in a river that continues to flow. Better to learn to swim, even awkwardly, than to stand rigid and be swept under.

Every change is, in some measure, a loss - even if the outcome is positive. And every loss deserves mourning. But let us not confuse mourning with despair. Grief honours what has passed. Despair denies that anything worthwhile can follow.

Change is constant and there is a constant within the change. This constant anchors us as we navigate through change. Routine, ritual, relationships, a sense-of-self â€” these are some anchors that help us navigate the changing currents. When the outer world reshapes itself, these inner tethers remind us of who we are in essence, not merely in circumstance.

We must reframe uncertainty not as a threat, but as an invitation to wonder, to adapt, to grow. To say "I don't know what comes next" is not a confession of failure. It is a declaration of openness. Of humility. Of life still unfolding. Be curious about what comes next.

## What We Can Do

In my own life, I have found that I have responded to change in all the varieties, from resistance to embrace, even when I have been the one initiating it. Sometimes I want to stop the world and get off, to find a place where I can catch my breath and feel secure again. But I have also learned that this is not how life works. The world does not stop for us, nor should it.

There are things, of course, we can do more practically:

* We can pause, breathe, and be in the moment.
* We can break the vast unknown into smaller, knowable steps.
* We can ask questions, seek wisdom, and prepare.
* We can speak with others, and in doing so, remember that the burden of change need not be borne alone.

And we can remind ourselves, often, that we have done this before. That every chapter we once feared, we now call memory. That every skill we now possess was once unfamiliar. That the knowledge we have is borne from experience.

## The Invitation of Change

Ultimately, change is not a punishment, it is a summons.

It asks us to let go, but only so that we might receive.

It asks us to walk through uncertainty, but only so we might discover clarity on the other side.

It asks us to shed old identities, not to leave us naked, but to allow new selves to emerge.

And perhaps that is the great paradox: we long for permanence, yet it is impermanence that teaches us how to live.

So let us not seek to master change as if it were a problem to solve. Let us instead learn to befriend it, as one might befriend the seasons, the tide, the turning sky. Not always with ease. Not always with joy. But with the deep, enduring recognition that to change is to be alive.

And to live well is not to escape change, but to move with it gracefully, courageously, and with eyes wide open to what might yet be.
