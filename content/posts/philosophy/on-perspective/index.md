There has been a lot of noise recently in the news and elsewhere with regards to pay increases, such as doctors and teachers threatening [strike action over pay increases of 4% (or more)](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8jg1zyejeno).

To which my initial response was “have some perspective, some people are getting a smaller percentage increase” only to find my words echoed back to me. Shock, horror, I was caught in my own hypocrisy. It is all about perspective but what is it?

## Perspective is a truth

Perspective is a view of what and how we see the world, it is what makes up the truth we witness, but a perspective, our perspective, is scoped only to us. The truth we build off this perspective is limited, so in order to get a richer, fuller truth we must consider other perspectives. 

This is not to say that we should adopt a Panglossian approach to considering other perspectives, as it is most certainly true that someone else has it worse than us, and if we don’t like the circumstances we find ourselves in, we are free to change them. Whether that is through collective action, individual choice, or acceptance of the situation. But getting other perspectives allows us to understand why the situation exists in the first place. 


## How can we gain perspective?

We already have our own perspective, so why do we need others? Gaining perspective is really a matter of gaining truth, by piecing together different views that exist of an event. 

Ultimately, we can only gain perspective through openness and curiosity. If we’re not open, any additional perspective will be closed to us. If we’re not curious, we’ll never find additional perspectives. 

But a word of caution prevails - perspectives are as flawed as the humans that create them. They are ingrained with our biases and our belief systems, so untangling all that will provide clarity, even though the task to distill truth from perspective is difficult and a skill that needs constant practice. 

In Mission Impossible: Final Reckoning (the beacon of philosophical knowledge), one character apologises to another character for ruining their life. The other character responds by saying it’s all a matter of perspective, if the first character hadn’t done what they did, then this character would not have lived the life they had. 

## The truth will set us free

By holding dearly onto our own perspectives, we are blinded to other possibilities and a deeper understanding of ourselves and the world around us. By only focusing on ourselves we end up creating friction with others when previously there was none. A cynic would say that the friction is an intended consequence of the event, but that denies us our own agency. 

Nothing that happens to us, the decisions that we make, our reactions to events are predestined (which is really to do with salvation). We have agency in all of this and to deny agency is to deny our humanity and shrug all responsibility off to someone or something else - at which point we are no better than machines. Perspective shapes us, but it is not us. 

By gathering different perspectives we can get a glimmer of the truth and understand why the world is the way it is. We don’t have to like it and, if we don’t like it, we have the agency to change it. But, at least, we will have understood others and ourselves in the process. 

The truth will set us free because we are free to make our choices, to live a live we want to live, without resentment towards others because we have a collection of perspectives.
