In a previous post, we explored what the [data domains](../data-domain-case-study-retail/) could look like for our fictional retailer - XclusiV. In this post, we will explore how the data products could work in this fictional case study, including how pure data consumers would handle the data - particularly those consumers who have a holistic view of an organisation (also a group of consumers for whom a traditional analytical model is perfect). 

We won't go through every domain identified in the previous post, instead we'll focus on the Customer Domain and the data consumers of Group Finance and Senior Management. 

As a reminder, below is our hypothetical flow of data between the domains established in the previous post:
