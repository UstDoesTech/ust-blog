# Ust. Brand Guidelines v2

**Visual identity system for Ust · ustdoes.tech · Advancing Analytics**

---

## Brand Essence

**The curious expert who shows their working.**

Ust isn't a consultancy brand. It's a person — someone who builds distributed computing frameworks named after bees, writes literary horror in triple helix structure, and treats data governance like a design problem. The brand should feel like sitting next to the most interesting person at the conference: technically rigorous, philosophically curious, and never boring.

## Brand Values — and How They Show Up Visually

| Value | What it means | How it manifests |
|-------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Curiosity** | Following ideas wherever they lead | Branching visuals, connecting lines, "what if" framing, honeycomb as a linking device, open-ended layouts |
| **Empathy** | Meeting people where they are | Warm tones, generous whitespace, accessible language, no jargon without explanation, inviting entry points |
| **Simplicity** | Clarity as a form of respect | Clean hierarchy, restrained palette, 80/20 accent rule, no decoration without purpose |
| **Purpose** | Everything earns its place | Structured layouts for structured content, deliberate colour choices, every element has a job |
| **Transparency** | Showing your working | Visible process, open reasoning, layered information (summary → detail), nothing hidden behind polish |
| **Playfulness** | The wink that makes it memorable | Unexpected details, warm wit in labels and callouts, the amber dot, imperfect-on-purpose moments, personality in data viz |

## Content Pillars

Every piece of content fits one of five pillars. Each pillar shares the same brand system but has its own **tonal register** — a subtle visual shift that tells the reader what kind of thinking they're about to encounter.

### Strategy

*The structured thinker. Governance, semantic layers, data architecture, business cases.*

- **Dominant colour:** Deep Teal
- **Tone:** Authoritative but warm. Georgia headings at full weight. Clean card layouts, structured grids. This is the most "composed" register.
- **Visual cues:** Ordered columns, numbered sequences, clear hierarchy. The teal left-bar. Data tables and charts.
- **Marker tag:** Teal badge

### Automation

*The builder. AI agents, scripts, pipelines, things that run while you sleep.*

- **Dominant colour:** Sage Green → Amber accents
- **Tone:** Practical, hands-on. More Consolas, more code blocks. Show the thing working.
- **Visual cues:** Terminal-style code blocks, before/after comparisons, pipeline flow diagrams. Dark navy code backgrounds.
- **Marker tag:** Sage badge

### Philosophy

*The questioner. Mental models, first principles, reframing problems, "why" before "how."*

- **Dominant colour:** Navy + Amber
- **Tone:** Open, spacious, unhurried. More whitespace than any other register. Fewer visual elements. Let the idea breathe.
- **Visual cues:** Wide margins, minimal graphics, pull-quote emphasis, generous line height. Connecting dotted lines between ideas. Honeycomb as linking device.
- **Marker tag:** Navy badge with amber dot

### Thought Experiments

*The "what if." Speculative, exploratory, deliberately unresolved.*

- **Dominant colour:** Amber-led with coral sparks
- **Tone:** Playful, provocative, curiosity made visible. This is where the brand loosens its tie. Branching paths, open questions, visual forks.
- **Visual cues:** Diverging arrows, question marks as design elements, incomplete hexagons (open shapes suggesting "not finished yet"), dotted/dashed lines. Hand-drawn feel is permitted here.
- **Marker tag:** Amber badge

### Personal

*The human. Swimming, fatherhood, horror writing, things learned from living.*

- **Dominant colour:** Navy + warm off-white only
- **Tone:** Stripped back, intimate. No gradient bar. No footer. No brand machinery. Just Georgia and the words. This register earns trust by showing vulnerability.
- **Visual cues:** Minimal — almost typographic only. No cards or boxes. Generous margins. One accent colour maximum per piece. The amber dot still appears as a quiet signature.
- **Marker tag:** No badge. Personal content doesn't need to be categorised — it just needs to be honest.

## Colour Palette

### Core Colours

| Colour | Hex | Role | Usage |
|--------|-----|------|-------|
| **Deep Teal** | `#0A6E6E` | Primary / Brand Anchor | Headers, primary buttons, links, strategy content |
| **Dark Navy** | `#0D1B2A` | Depth / Authority | Backgrounds (dark mode), text (light mode), code blocks |
| **Sage Green** | `#4A7C6F` | Secondary / Organic | Automation content, supporting graphics, natural/process elements |
| **Honey Amber** | `#F5A623` | Accent / Warmth | CTAs, highlights, the signature dot, thought experiment content |
| **Electric Coral** | `#FF4F58` | Accent / Punch | Alerts, emphasis, sparingly — the exclamation mark in your visual vocabulary |

### The 80/20 Rule

Deep Teal, Sage Green, and Dark Navy carry **80% of visual weight**. Honey Amber and Electric Coral are reserved for **emphasis only** — CTAs, tags, data highlights, and moments of surprise. Overusing the accents dilutes their impact.

**Exception:** Thought experiment content inverts this — amber leads, with teal/navy supporting. This deliberate inversion signals "we're exploring, not concluding."

## Typography

All fonts are **natively available in Microsoft Office** — no installation, no substitution issues.

### Font Stack

| Role | Font | Weight | Fallbacks |
|------|------|--------|-----------|
| **Headings** | Georgia | Bold | Times New Roman, serif |
| **Body** | Segoe UI | Regular / Semibold | Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif |
| **Code & Data** | Consolas | Regular | Courier New, monospace |

### Type Scale

| Level | Font | Size | Weight | Notes |
|-------|------|------|--------|-------|
| H1 | Georgia | 36px / 28pt | Bold | Title slides, article headlines |
| H2 | Georgia | 26px / 20pt | Bold | Section headings |
| H3 | Georgia | 20px / 15pt | Bold | Subsections |
| Body | Segoe UI | 15px / 11pt | Regular | Default reading text |
| Body emphasis | Segoe UI | 15px / 11pt | Semibold | Inline emphasis |
| Code | Consolas | 13px / 10pt | Regular | Code blocks, data values, technical labels |
| Caption / Label | Segoe UI | 11px / 8pt | Semibold, uppercase | Section labels, tags, metadata |
| Pull quote | Georgia | 22px / 16pt | Italic | Emphasis quotes — philosophy & thought experiment content |

### Typography by Register

- **Strategy:** Full hierarchy. H1 → H2 → Body. Everything labelled and structured.
- **Automation:** More Consolas. Inline code in body text. Tighter spacing.
- **Philosophy:** Larger body text (17px/13pt). More generous line height (1.8). Pull quotes in Georgia Italic.
- **Thought experiments:** Mixed — questions in Georgia Italic, exploration in Segoe UI. Deliberate tension between the two.
- **Personal:** Georgia for everything. Body in Georgia Regular at 16px/12pt. The serif warmth carries the voice.

## The Playfulness System

Playfulness is not decoration. It's personality. Here's where and how it shows up:

### The Amber Dot

The signature micro-accent. It appears on every slide, every page, every piece of content — but never in the same place. It's a quiet "I was here." On title slides it sits bottom-right. On blog posts it might punctuate the wordmark. On personal content it might be the only colour on the page.

### Wit in Labels

Data viz labels, chart annotations, tag names, and callout text are where personality lives. Instead of "Key Findings" write "What the data is trying to tell us." Instead of "Process Flow" write "How the sausage gets made." The visual system is restrained — the copy is where you play.

### Imperfect-on-Purpose Moments

Not every hexagon needs to close. Not every line needs to be straight. In thought experiment and personal content, allow for visual incompleteness — an open path, a dashed line, an unfinished shape. These signal "we're still thinking" and give the brand texture that pure geometric precision can't.

### The Easter Egg Principle

Every presentation, every long-form post should have at least one moment that rewards close attention. A subtle reference in the footnotes. An unexpected data point. A code comment that makes someone smile. This is the difference between a brand that's admired and a brand that's loved.

---

## The Curiosity Pattern

Curiosity is the brand's engine. Visually, it manifests as **connection** — the act of linking ideas across domains.

### The Honeycomb as Connective Tissue

The honeycomb is not a logo. It's a visual metaphor for how ideas connect. Use it to:

- Link related concepts (dotted lines between hexagonal nodes)
- Show knowledge graphs and ontologies
- Create "exploration maps" for thought experiment content
- Frame "see also" connections at the end of articles

### Branching Paths

For thought experiments and philosophy content, use diverging lines and forking paths instead of linear timelines. Visual forks signal "there's more than one way to think about this."

### The Question Mark as Design Element

In thought experiment content, the question mark can be used as a large, lightly rendered background element (at 10-15% opacity). It sets the tone without being heavy-handed.

### Connecting Across Pillars

When content bridges pillars (e.g. a philosophical take on automation, a personal reflection on strategy), use **dual marker tags** and visual elements from both registers. This reinforces that the most interesting ideas live at intersections.

---

## Tonal Registers — Slide Deck Application

### Strategy Slides

- Gradient top-bar (Teal → Sage → Amber)
- Georgia Bold headings, Segoe UI body
- Teal left-bar on title slides
- Structured grid layouts, numbered cards
- Footer with "Ust · Advancing Analytics" attribution

### Automation Slides

- Navy code block backgrounds featured prominently
- More Consolas usage — in headings where appropriate
- Before/After and pipeline flow layouts
- Sage green as dominant accent
- Terminal-style elements (prompt indicators, syntax highlighting)

### Philosophy Slides

- Minimal layouts — more whitespace than content
- Navy background with warm off-white text (dark mode preferred)
- Large Georgia Italic pull quotes as hero elements
- No more than three visual elements per slide
- Connecting dotted lines between ideas
- No footer — let the ideas stand alone

### Thought Experiment Slides

- Amber-dominant with coral sparks
- Open hexagon shapes (incomplete, suggesting "in progress")
- Forking path diagrams instead of linear flows
- Question framing — slide titles as questions, not statements
- Dashed borders on cards (not solid) to suggest impermanence

### Personal Slides

- If used at all, absolute minimum brand apparatus
- Warm off-white background, navy text, amber dot only
- Georgia for everything including body
- No gradient bar, no footer, no tag badges
- Photography permitted here (not in other registers)

## Showing Your Working (Transparency)

Transparency isn't just a value statement — it's a visual practice.

### Layered Information

Present information at multiple depths: headline → summary → detail → source. Let people choose how deep to go. In slide decks, this means progressive disclosure: key insight on the main slide, supporting data in speaker notes.

### Process Visibility

When presenting conclusions, show the path. Use timeline/roadmap layouts not just for future plans but for past reasoning: "We started here → discovered this → which led to this conclusion." Make the messy middle visible.

### Source Attribution

Always cite. In slide decks, small Consolas footnotes with data sources. On the blog, inline links. This isn't about academic rigour — it's about showing people where to look if they want to check your working.

### Honest Data Viz

Never truncate axes to exaggerate trends. Always label clearly. If the data is ambiguous, say so — visually. Use confidence intervals, ranges, or "?" annotations. Honest data viz is a brand differentiator in a world of cherry-picked charts.

## Content Tags

| Pillar | Background | Text |
|--------|-----------|------|
| Strategy | Deep Teal `#0A6E6E` | White |
| Automation | Sage Green `#4A7C6F` | White |
| Philosophy | Dark Navy `#0D1B2A` | White, with amber dot before text |
| Thought Experiment | Honey Amber `#F5A623` | Navy |
| Personal | None — no tag | — |

Tags use Segoe UI Semibold, 11px, uppercase, with 0.5px letter-spacing.

When content bridges two pillars, show both tags side by side.

---

## Wordmark

Georgia Bold with coloured punctuation:

> **Ust** <span style="color:#F5A623">**.**</span> **does** <span style="color:#0A6E6E">**.**</span> **tech**

- The amber dot after "Ust" is the signature micro-accent
- The teal dot before "tech" reinforces the primary brand colour
- In minimal contexts (personal content), just "Ust." with the amber dot is sufficient

---

## Contrast Pairings (Accessibility)

| Combination | Foreground | Background | Use Case |
|-------------|-----------|------------|----------|
| Body text (light) | `#0D1B2A` | `#F4F1EC` | Default reading |
| Body text (dark) | `#E8E4DD` | `#0D1B2A` | Default reading |
| White on Teal | `#FFFFFF` | `#0A6E6E` | Primary buttons, headers |
| Navy on Amber | `#0D1B2A` | `#F5A623` | CTA buttons, thought experiment tags |
| Teal on Surface (light) | `#0A6E6E` | `#FFFFFF` | Links, labels |
| Teal on Surface (dark) | `#0A6E6E` | `#162738` | Links, labels |

## Icon Library

36 custom SVG icons across four categories, designed with the brand's geometric style and hexagonal motifs. Full reference sheet provided separately.

- **Data & Tech** (10): Database, API, Pipeline, Cloud, Terminal, Data Lake, Schema, Query, Cluster, Unity Catalog
- **Business & Strategy** (9): Analytics, Target, Roadmap, Team, Growth, Lightbulb, Presentation, Budget, Innovation
- **Governance & Compliance** (10): Shield, Lock, Checklist, Policy, Certificate, Monitoring, Balance, Alert, GDPR, Lineage
- **Brand / Apiary** (7): Hexagon, Honeycomb, Bee, Swarm, Apiary Mark, Amber Dot, Teal Bar

Icons use navy outlines at 1.8px with brand colour accents. The incomplete hexagon variant (for thought experiment content) uses dashed strokes.

### Personality in Data

- Label axes with plain language, not jargon
- Add annotations that tell the story ("This is where it gets interesting →")
- Use Consolas for values, Segoe UI for narrative labels
- If the data surprised you, say so in the annotation
- Never let a chart speak for itself without context

### Honest Defaults

- Always start bar chart axes at zero
- Show ranges and uncertainty where relevant
- Label data sources in Consolas at 8pt, bottom-left
- If comparing, make the comparison fair and visible
