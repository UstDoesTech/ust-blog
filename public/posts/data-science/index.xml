      <description>&lt;p&gt;What comes to your mind when you hear the words forecasting, forecasts etc?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Invariably, you’ll think of weather forecasts. But forecasts are much more than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forecasting is the process of making predictions of the future based on past and present data and analysis of trends. It’s a process that has existed for millennia, though often with dubious methodologies… Instead of looking in to a crystal ball to predict the future we are going to employ the power of statistics!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
