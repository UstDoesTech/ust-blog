    <p>I had written a post entitled The Intent Deficit but as I was doing wider reading the nature of the post changed (I still have the draft of the original) from “we need to have intent with how we use tools” to “what is the meaning of life”. And it’s this article in Rolling Stone that triggered the change.
I pivoted to “what is the meaning of life” because there are existential challenges that we face as a species. We are at a crossroads in our evolution. We have the ability to create life, but we also have the ability to destroy ourselves.

    <p>I never thought I would be writing a post about French verbs. Metadata, sure. That goes with the territory. But French verbs?
Since moving to France in 2022, I’ve been learning the language. I’m not fluent yet, but I can get by - especially in high-stress situations. I have French lessons and supplement them with Duolingo. I’m not a linguist, but I’m fascinated by the way language works. I love the way it can be used to express complex ideas and emotions. The foundation of learning any language is through verbs.

    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>In a recent blog post I mentioned that I have been thinking about novel applications to mathematics. One of the areas I have been exploring is the concept of numerical impermanence. And you’re probably thinking, “are you on drugs?” - which is what my wife asked me when I said I had been having fun with maths (she misheard me and thought I said “meth”).
Since moving to France in 2022 and having my world turned upside down with the move, coupled with the deaths of my grandfather and the Queen, my identity was uncertain. With the help of the teachings of Thich Nhat Hanh, I have been leaning on impermanence to help me stay grounded and navigate the chaos of life. Mathematics, on the whole, is a grounded discipline, but it is also a discipline that is constantly evolving. The concept of impermanence is not new, but it is one that I have been thinking about in the context of mathematics and how we can apply it to more than just understanding life.

It has been a while! Life happens and has a way of distracting us from some of the things we love. I have been busy with work and family - still posting content elsewhere, some of which I might share here in the future, others will be left to stay where they are. It’s valuable content in the context in which it was created, but not necessarily valuable in the context of this blog. I have been thinking about how to get back into the swing of things and I think I have a good topic for today.

    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Self-serve, or self-service, has been around in various guises for decades from Automatic Teller Machines (ATMs) through to self-serve analytics. With the advent of spreadsheeting tools, self-serve analytics has arguably been around for a long time, and with the more recent introduction of dedicated self-serve Business Intelligence tools, self-serve has become embedded in the analytics vernacular.
But what do we really mean when we say “self-serve”? In my experience, we all have different interpretations and understanding of what we mean - and those interpretations will be specific to the context in which we operate. For some, self-serve could mean allowing the end-user to author their own reports. For others, it could mean allowing the end-user to be fully involved in the onboarding, curation and sharing of data.

    <p>Problem Interactive and SQL Warehouse (formerly known as SQL Endpoint) clusters take time to become active. This can range from around 5 mins through to almost 10 mins. For some workloads and users, this waiting time can be frustrating if not unacceptable.
For this use case, we had streaming clusters that needed to be available for when streams started at 07:00 and to be turned off when streams stopped being sent at 21:00. Similarly, there was also need from business users for their SQL Warehouse clusters to be available for when business started trading so that their BI reports didn’t timeout waiting for the clusters to start.

    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Context A project that I’m working on uses Azure Synapse Serverless as a serving layer option for its data platform. The main processing and transformation of data is achieved using Databricks, with the resulting data being made available as a Delta file.
Our processes ensure that the Delta files are registered automatically within Databricks as Delta Tables, but there is no native way to register Delta objects in Synapse. Therefore, we’ve gone down a route of creating a series of Stored Procedures in Synapse - which can be called from Databricks - which register the Delta files as views within Synapse. There are performance considerations to be understood with this approach - namely the use of loosely typed data. For example, a string in Delta is converted to VARCHAR(8000) in Synapse. This approach isn’t for everyone, so use with caution.

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Data is among the most valuable assets for any organisation. Without data, the ability to make informed decisions is diminished. So it stands to reason that Data Quality is incredibly important to any organisation. If data doesn’t meet the expectations of accuracy, validity, completeness, and consistency that an organisation sets it, then the data could have severe implications for the organisation. Conversely, if data does meet those expectations, then it is a real asset that can be used to drive value across an organisation.

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Problem Databricks’ Auto Loader has the ability to infer a schema from a sample of files. This means that you don’t have to provide a schema, which is really handy when you’re dealing with an unknown schema or a wide and complex schema, which you don’t always want to define up-front.
But what happens if the schema that has been inferred isn’t the schema you were expecting or it contains fields which you definitely don’t want to ingest - like PCI or PII data fields?

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Problem Recently on a client project, we wanted to use the Auto Loader functionality in Databricks to easily consume from AWS S3 into our Azure hosted data platform. The reason why we opted for Auto Loader over any other solution is because it natively exists within Databricks and allows us to quickly ingest data from Azure Storage Accounts and AWS S3 Buckets, while using the benefits of Structured Streaming to checkpoint which files it last loaded. It also means we’re less dependent upon additional systems to provide that “what did we last load” context.
